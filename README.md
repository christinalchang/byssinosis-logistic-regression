# Multivariate Modeling of Byssinosis Data in R

The dataset contains the number of workers in a survey of the US cotton industry suffering and not suffering 
from the lung disease Byssinosis, together with the values of five cross-classifying categorical explanatory variables: 
the race, sex and smoking habit of the worker, the length of employment in three categories, and the dustiness of the 
workplace in three categories.

I will investigate the relationships between Byssinosis and the explanatory variables with model fitting using logistic regression, model selection, and model diagnostics.
