# Logistic Regression of Byssinosis Data in R

The dataset contains the number of workers in a survey of the US cotton industry suffering and not suffering 
from the lung disease byssinosis, together with the values of five cross-classifying categorical explanatory variables: 
the race, sex and smoking habit of the worker, the length of employment in three categories, and the dustiness of the 
workplace in three categories.

I will investigate the relationships between the disease and the explanatory variables by using diagnostics and model
selection.
